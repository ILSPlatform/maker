# Code Generator for OroPlatform-based applications (Oro Maker Bundle)

OroMakerBundle provides a set of generators that allow creation of the basic code for your project blazing fast with deep 
utilization of the OroPlatform functionality.

For more information, see online documentation on [Code Generator for OroPlatform-based Applications](https://doc.oroinc.com/bundles/extensions/MakerBundle/).

# MakerBundle for Oro 4.2 (ILSPlatform/maker)
Downgraded dependencies for Oro 4.2, since Oro's maker for the Symfony Maker bundle was not available until Oro 5.0.  This is the Oro 5.0 version downgraded dependency for Symfony maker-bundle 1.39 which is available for 4.2. 

This might become a dev dependency in the ILSPlatform/storefront-platform repo until it is upgraded to Oro version 5+.

As of 8/8/2013, generated code has not been fully tested yet, but the generator does create files successfully. Reference documentation for Oro 5.0 when viewing the documentation link [Code Generator for OroPlatform-based Applications](https://doc.oroinc.com/bundles/extensions/MakerBundle/).
